# About

This project is part of the KFS (Kernel From Scratch) series at 42 Wolfsburg.
The goal of the project is to explore operating system development by building
a kernel incrementally from scratch, focusing on low-level concepts such as booting,
memory management, and CPU interaction

This documentation is written as a companion to the codebase. It is intended for:

- The project authors, as a long-term reference
- 42 students working on or reviewing KFS
- Anyone interested in low-level systems programming
